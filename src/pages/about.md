## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of the interwebs, svdoscience.com.

My name is Joel, and while at work I am an SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) / QA engineer, I'm generally interested in all things code.

I like to keep my eyes out for new technologies, take them for a spin, and then write about my experiences with them when I can remember to do so ðŸ˜…

Keep an eye out for new blog posts, and maybe eventually videos!
